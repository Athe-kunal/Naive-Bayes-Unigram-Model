Catherine blushed  disclaimed   gentlemans predictions 
verified    something    words  repaid

Such  strain  shallow artifice   impose even upon Catherine
 inconsistencies contradictions  falsehood struck   
very first   ashamed  Isabella  ashamed  having 
loved   professions  attachment  now  disgusting  
excuses  empty   demands impudent Write  James

Henry bowed  assent

Well             Though  
turned out  well            happens
   great harm done     think Isabella  
heart  lose  suppose   made  very much  love  

   first suppose Isabella     heart

  very right    stand   brother

    stand  yours     much distressed 
 disappointment  Miss Thorpe   mind  warped   innate
principle  general integrity  therefore  accessible   cool
reasonings  family partiality   desire  revenge

Catherine  complimented out  further bitterness Frederick 
  unpardonably guilty  Henry made himself  agreeable 
resolved   answering Isabellas letter  tried  think  more
 




CHAPTER 


Soon    general found himself obliged  go  London 
 week   left Northanger earnestly regretting   necessity
 rob  even   hour  Miss Morlands company  anxiously
recommending  study   comfort  amusement   children
  chief object   absence  departure gave Catherine 
first experimental conviction   loss   sometimes  gain 
happiness    time now passed  employment voluntary
 laugh indulged  meal  scene  ease  good humour

each moment  each day   perfectly happy    now 
 fourth week   visit before  general came home  fourth
week   turned  perhaps   seem  intrusion  
stayed much longer    painful consideration whenever 
occurred  eager   rid  such  weight   mind  very
soon resolved  speak  Eleanor    once propose going away
  guided   conduct   manner    proposal 
 taken

Aware    gave herself much time   feel  difficult 
bring forward  unpleasant  subject  took  first opportunity 
being suddenly alone  Eleanor   Eleanors being  
middle   speech  something very different  start forth 
obligation  going away very soon Eleanor looked  declared herself
much concerned   hoped   pleasure   company  
much longer timehad  misled perhaps   wishes  suppose
  much longer visit   promisedand    think 
 Mr  Mrs Morland  aware   pleasure      
      generous  hasten  return Catherine
explained Oh    Papa  Mamma    hurry   
long    happy   always  satisfied

    ask  such  hurry herself  leave 

Oh       long

Nay    use such  word   urge   farther  
think  long

Oh     indeed    pleasure   stay   
long again    directly settled  till    leaving
   even   thought   having  cause  uneasiness
 pleasantly removed  force     likewise weakened 
kindness  earnestness  Eleanors manner  pressing   stay
 Henrys gratified look  being told   stay  determined
 such sweet proofs   importance    left  
  much solicitude   human mind  never  comfortably
without  didalmost alwaysbelieve  Henry loved   quite
always   father  sister loved  even wished   belong
   believing  far  doubts  anxieties  merely
sportive irritations

Henry     obey  fathers injunction  remaining wholly
 Northanger  attendance   ladies during  absence  London
 engagements   curate  Woodston obliging   leave  
Saturday   couple  nights  loss   now    
  general   home  lessened  gaiety

  quickly decided  Eleanor    eldest brother whose
arrival    sudden   quite  unseasonable 
accordingly  hurried down  welcome 

Catherine walked    chamber making up  mind  well  
   further acquaintance  Captain Tilney  comforting
herself under  unpleasant impression  conduct  given

  Eleanor stood  Catherines spirits

  mistaken indeed returned Eleanor looking   
compassionately    one  Woodston    father himself
 voice faltered   eyes  turned   ground  
mentioned  name  unlookedfor return  enough  itself  make
Catherines heart sink    few moments  hardly supposed
  anything worse   told   nothing  Eleanor
endeavouring  collect herself  speak  firmness   eyes
still cast down soon went     good   sure  think
 worse     part   obliged  perform   indeed  
unwilling messenger     lately passed  lately
