Oh yes  ought    spoken   uncle     
quite astonished  uncle      living  many years
  whatever  faults     very fond   brother
treating    quite   son     believed 

 thought    struck   very wrong very indecorous

 very ungrateful  think

Ungrateful   strong word    know   uncle   claim
  gratitude  wife certainly      warmth  
respect   aunts memory  misleads  here   awkwardly
circumstanced  such warm feelings  lively spirits   
difficult   justice   affection  Mrs Crawford without
throwing  shade   Admiral    pretend  know   
 blame   disagreements though  Admirals present conduct
 incline one   side   wife    natural  amiable
 Miss Crawford  acquit  aunt entirely    censure 
opinions   certainly  impropriety  making  public

   think  Fanny   little consideration  
impropriety   reflection itself upon Mrs Crawford   niece 
 entirely brought up      given  right notions
   due   Admiral

   fair remark Yes   suppose  faults   niece
   those   aunt   makes one more sensible  
disadvantages    under   think  present home 
  good Mrs Grants manners     ought   
speaks   brother   very pleasing affection

Yes except    writing  such short letters  made 
 laugh    rate  very highly  love  goodnature
  brother    give himself  trouble  writing anything
worth reading   sisters    separated   sure William
 never  used   under  circumstances   right
   suppose     write long letters   
absent

 right   lively mind Fanny seizing whatever  contribute
   amusement    others perfectly allowable 
untinctured  illhumour  roughness      shadow 
   countenance  manner  Miss Crawford nothing sharp 
loud  coarse   perfectly feminine except   instances

CHAPTER X

 quarter   hour twenty minutes passed away  Fanny  still
thinking  Edmund Miss Crawford  herself without interruption
  one  began   surprised  being left  long  
listen   anxious desire  hearing  steps   voices
again  listened   length  heard  heard voices  feet
approaching     satisfied herself     those
 wanted  Miss Bertram Mr Rushworth  Mr Crawford issued
  same path    trod herself   before 

Miss Price  alone    Fanny  comes   
first salutations  told  story Poor  Fanny cried 
cousin  ill    used     better  staid
 

 seating herself   gentleman  each side  resumed
 conversation   engaged  before  discussed 
possibility  improvements  much animation Nothing  fixed
  Henry Crawford  full  ideas  projects  generally
speaking whatever  proposed  immediately approved first  
   Mr Rushworth whose principal business seemed   
hear  others   scarcely risked  original thought   
beyond  wish    seen  friend Smiths place

  minutes spent   way Miss Bertram observing  iron
gate expressed  wish  passing through    park  
views   plans   more comprehensive    very thing
  others   wished    best     way 
proceeding   advantage  Henry Crawfords opinion  
directly saw  knoll  half  mile    give  exactly
 requisite command   house Go therefore    
knoll  through  gate   gate  locked Mr Rushworth
wished   brought  key    very near thinking whether 
  bring  key   determined   never come without
 key again  still    remove  present evil 
   through   Miss Bertrams inclination   doing
   means lessen  ended  Mr Rushworths declaring outright
   go  fetch  key  set  accordingly

  undoubtedly  best thing    now     far 
 house already  Mr Crawford    gone

Yes   nothing    done  now sincerely   
find  place altogether worse   expected

 style though  style     best   tell  
truth speaking  lower    think   shall  see
Sotherton again   much pleasure    now Another summer 
hardly improve   

  moments embarrassment  lady replied    much 
man   world   see   eyes   world   people
think Sotherton improved    doubt   

  afraid    quite  much  man   world   
good     points  feelings   quite  evanescent 
 memory   past under such easy dominion  one finds   
case  men   world

  followed   short silence Miss Bertram began again 
seemed  enjoy  drive here very much  morning   glad 
see   well entertained   Julia  laughing  whole way

  Yes  believe         recollection
  Oh  believe   relating    ridiculous stories 
 old Irish groom   uncles  sister loves  laugh

 think  more lighthearted   

More easily amused  replied consequently  know smiling
better company     hoped  entertain   Irish
anecdotes during  ten miles drive

Naturally  believe    lively  Julia    more  think
 now

  undoubtedly    situations   very high
spirits  denote insensibility  prospects   
fair  justify want  spirits    very smiling scene before

unluckily  iron gate  haha give   feeling  restraint 
hardship    out   starling    spoke 
   expression  walked   gate  followed  Mr
Rushworth   long fetching  key

   world     out without  key  without Mr
Rushworths authority  protection   think    little
difficulty pass round  edge   gate here   assistance

Fanny  again left   solitude    increase  pleasant
feelings    sorry       seen  heard
astonished  Miss Bertram  angry  Mr Crawford  taking
 circuitous route    appeared   very unreasonable
direction   knoll   soon beyond  eye   
minutes longer  remained without sight  sound   companion
 seemed    little wood   herself   
 thought  Edmund  Miss Crawford  left     
impossible  Edmund  forget   entirely

  again roused  disagreeable musings  sudden footsteps
somebody  coming   quick pace down  principal walk 
expected Mr Rushworth    Julia  hot  out  breath
   look  disappointment cried out  seeing  Heyday
   others  thought Maria  Mr Crawford

place   always contrive  keep out   scrapes

    unjust reflection  Fanny  allow    
 pass Julia  vexed   temper  hasty   felt

 found herself more successful  sending away   retaining

common meaning    man       
 meant something very earnest very pointed   still tried

cousins  fifty  women

 thought   wishing  speak   unheard   rest 
fancied   trying    whole evening  intervals whenever

wellmeaning people   always doing mistaken  very disagreeable
things

Mrs Norris  relieved   pressed   strictest
