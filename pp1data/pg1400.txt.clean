 whenever     room  kept  eyes attentively  
guardian     remove  hands   dish  put
before  hesitatingly    dreaded  calling  back 
wanted   speak    nigh    anything   
fancied    detect   manner  consciousness    
purpose  always holding   suspense

Dinner went  gayly  although  guardian seemed  follow 
 originate subjects  knew   wrenched  weakest part 
 dispositions out    myself  found    expressing 
tendency  lavish expenditure   patronize Herbert   boast
  great prospects before  quite knew    opened  lips
          one more  Drummle

           cheese  
conversation turned upon  rowing feats   Drummle  rallied
 coming up behind   night   slow amphibious way  
Drummle upon  informed  host   much preferred  room

Now  housekeeper    time clearing  table  guardian
taking  heed      side   face turned  
 leaning back   chair biting  side   forefinger 
showing  interest  Drummle     quite inexplicable
Suddenly  clapped  large hand   housekeepers   trap

   repeated Drummle Oh Lord

   very aggravatingthe more especially   found myself
making  way against  surly obtusenessthat   disregarding
Herberts efforts  check 

Come Mr Drummle      subject Ill tell  
passed between Herbert here     borrowed  money

Drummle laughed outright  sat laughing   faces   hands
  pockets   round shoulders raised plainly signifying 
  quite true    despised   asses 

Hereupon Startop took   hand though   much better grace 
  shown  exhorted     little more agreeable Startop
being  lively bright young fellow  Drummle being  exact
opposite  latter  always disposed  resent    direct
personal affront  now retorted   coarse lumpish way  Startop
tried  turn  discussion aside   small pleasantry  made
  laugh Resenting  little success more  anything Drummle
without  threat  warning pulled  hands out   pockets
dropped  round shoulders swore took up  large glass

 clapping  hand   back  minea good fellow 
impetuosity  hesitation boldness  diffidence action 
dreaming curiously mixed  

 stopped   moment  consider whether  really   mixture
  character   whole    means recognized  analysis

suggest      thoughts     lucky  know  
done nothing  raise myself  life   Fortune alone  raised

Now Handel Herbert replied   gay hopeful way  seems  
   despondency   tender passion   looking  
gifthorses mouth   magnifyingglass Likewise  seems  
 concentrating  attention   examination  altogether
overlook one   best points   animal Didnt  tell  
 guardian Mr Jaggers told    beginning

Now Handel   quite free   flavor  sour grapes upon 
soul  honor  being bound      detach yourself

Chapter LIII

   dark night though  full moon rose   left  enclosed

Coming up again   marsh level out   excavationfor  rude

noose thrown over  head  behind

Now   suppressed voice   oath Ive

    arms pulled close   sides   pressure 
 bad arm caused  exquisite pain Sometimes  strong mans hand
sometimes  strong mans breast  set against  mouth  deaden

ineffectually   dark    fastened tight   wall 
now   suppressed voice  another oath call out again

Faint  sick   pain   injured arm bewildered
